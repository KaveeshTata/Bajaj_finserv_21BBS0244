# 21BBS0244: JSON Data Filter and Display with React and Flask

## Project Overview

This project is a simple web application that allows users to submit JSON data and filter the results based on specific criteria. The frontend is built using React, while the backend is developed using Flask. The application accepts JSON input, processes it on the backend, and then returns the filtered results based on selected criteria such as alphabets, numbers, and the highest lowercase alphabet.

## Features

- **JSON Input Validation**: The frontend accepts JSON input and validates it before sending it to the backend.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter the data based on different criteria like alphabets, numbers, and the highest lowercase alphabet.
- **Responsive UI**: The user interface is responsive and user-friendly.
- **Backend Validation**: The Flask backend ensures the data is properly structured and returns errors if there are any issues.
- **CORS Enabled**: The Flask backend is configured to handle cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
